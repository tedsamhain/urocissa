## Build from Source (Linux Version)

Follow these steps to set up and run the Picasu app on Linux-based systems. 

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-picasu-repo-url>
```

This will create a folder called `./picasu`.

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure the following software is installed on your system:

- **ffmpeg**: Install via your system's package manager. For Ubuntu, use APT:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
  ```

  For other Linux distributions, use the appropriate package manager (e.g., `dnf`, `yum`, `pacman`) and find the corresponding package name for installation.

- **Rust**: Install Rust using the official installer:

  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
  source $HOME/.cargo/env
  ```

- **npm (Node.js)**: Install Node.js (with npm). For Ubuntu, use APT:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
  ```

  For other Linux distributions, use the appropriate package manager (e.g., `dnf`, `yum`, `pacman`) and find the corresponding package name for installation.

### 3. Build the Frontend

```bash
npm run build
