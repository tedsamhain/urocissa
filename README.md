# Picasu

Picasu is a self-hosted gallery designed to serve massive collections, capable of handling millions of images and videos. It is built using Rust and Vue.

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to efficiently serve one million photos on a 4 GB RAM server, providing smooth scrubbable scrolling, infinite photo streams, and instant search and selection, without waiting for the entire database to load in the browser.

## Demo

You can explore the features of Picasu through the following demos:

### Standard Demo

[https://demo.photoserver.tw](https://demo.photoserver.tw)

This demo showcases the typical usage of Picasu, allowing you to experience its core features and user interface.

### One-Million-Photo Demo

[https://demo-million.photoserver.tw](https://demo-million.photoserver.tw)

This demo demonstrates Picasu's ability to manage 1,000,000 photos, showcasing the power and scalability of Picasu. Since I don't have access to a million unique images, the photos in this demo are replaced with placeholders.

Both demos are currently in read-only mode, and uploading files or editing tags is not permitted at this time.

## Advantages

- **Blazing Fast Performance**: Index photos with a pure Rust crate. Instantly serve, search, and filter one million photos in under a second using an in-memory cached database.

- **Memory Efficient**: Even with the entire database cached in memory, both the standard demo and the one-million-photo demo can run seamlessly on a single server with just 4 GB of RAM.

- **Infinite Photo Stream**: Experience endless scrolling without pagination. No lazy loading needed. Picasu uses advanced virtual scrolling to serve one million photos, overcoming the DOM height limit of 33,554,400px (see [TanStack/virtual#616](https://github.com/TanStack/virtual/issues/616)).

- **Instant Data Search**: Use boolean operators such as 'and', 'or', or 'not' to search your data instantly. Find examples of search queries [here](docs/SEARCH.md).

## Memory Usage Estimate

Picasu uses an in-memory cached database to ensure instant access and blazing-fast search. Based on real-world measurements, the following table estimates the RAM needed to handle large numbers of photos:

| Photo Count | Estimated RAM Usage |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| 1 million   | ~1.2 GiB            |
| 2 million   | ~2.4 GiB            |
| 3 million   | ~3.6 GiB            |
| 4 million   | ~4.8 GiB            |
| 5 million   | ~6.0 GiB            |
| 6 million   | ~7.2 GiB            |
| 8 million   | ~9.6 GiB            |
| 10 million  | ~12 GiB             |

These values are based on actual runtime RSS (resident memory) usage of the `picasu` process, measured during full data generation. In-memory usage may vary slightly depending on runtime allocator behavior, indexing options, or memory reuse patterns, but the scaling is approximately linear.

## Quick Setup

- **Linux Users**: To instantly set up and try Picasu using Docker, follow these steps:

### Quick Setup with Docker

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Start by cloning the Picasu repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-picasu-repo-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   Enter the newly created `picasu` directory:

   ```bash
   cd picasu
   ```

3. **Launch with Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This pulls the latest Picasu Docker image and starts it, storing config/data/images under `./picasu-data/` (see `compose.yaml` at the repo root). To build the image from source instead of pulling, see the commented-out `build:` section in `compose.yaml`.

You can access the app using the following link:

[http://127.0.0.1:5673](http://127.0.0.1:5673)

If you want to change the default port or configure a password, refer to the [Configuration Guide](docs/CONFIG.md).

### Quick Update with Docker

1. Navigate to the project directory and pull the latest updates:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

2. Pull the latest image and restart:

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Build from Source (Without Using Docker)

If you prefer to build and install Picasu from source, follow the relevant guide for your operating system:
